Credit card applications\n<p>Commercial banks receive <em>a lot</em> of applications for credit cards.

Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays.
