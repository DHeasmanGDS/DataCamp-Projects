Credit card applications\n<p>Commercial banks receive <em>a lot</em> of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_558/img/credit_card.jpg\" alt=\"Credit card being held in hand\"></p>\n<p>We'll use the <a href=\"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval\">Credit Card Approval dataset</a> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set\n<p>Essentially, predicting if a credit card application will be approved or not is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification\">classification</a> task. <a href=\"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/credit-screening/crx.names\">According to UCI</a>, our dataset contains more instances that correspond to \"Denied\" status than instances corresponding to \"Approved\" status.

A good machine learning model should be able to accurately predict the status of the applications with respect to these statistics.</p>\n<p>Which model should we pick? A question to ask is: <em>are the features that affect the credit card approval decision process correlated with each other?</em> Although we can measure correlation, that is outside the scope of this notebook, so we'll rely on our intuition that they indeed are correlated for now. Because of this correlation, we'll take advantage of the fact that generalized linear models perform well in these cases.
